## Introduction

The client would like to be able to write and save notes so that they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.

## Problem

The notes should be easily jotted down and saved, then easily retrieved and restored in the list of notes. They could also be deleted, if not longer needed.

## Solution

I created the backend applicaton for the client's previously developed frontend website. The user can create a new note, which gets stored. They can then recall that note at a later date. The user can also delete the note, if they no longer need it.
