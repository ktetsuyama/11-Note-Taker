## Introduction

The client would like to be able to write and save notes so that they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.

## Problem

The notes should be easily jotted down and saved, then easily retrieved and restored in the list of notes.

## Solution

I created the backend applicaton for the client's previously developed frontend website.

Here is a video of the application in action:
